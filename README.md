# Javascript-Movie-Dates
A Javascript site that I create that displays the amount of time since a past movie came out and the amount of time left for a future movie to come out. I got the past movie to partially work with some problems, but I'm still trying to figure out how to make numbers show for the future movie rather than simply saying "NaN".
