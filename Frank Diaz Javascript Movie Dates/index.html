<p>This site will showcase the important use of the Date() Object in Javascript. I will use this object to calculate the dates and times for movies from the past and from the future. So sit back and enjoy my fun little project.</p>

<h4>The Iron Giant is one of my favorite animated movies of all time that was a big part of my early childhood. Released on August 6, 1999, the movie sadly didn't do well in the box office due to Warner Bros. doing a poor job at marketing the movie, the movie was eventually well received and critically acclaimed by critics and fans over the following decades and has since become a huge part of popular culture. The movie takes place in 1957 during the height of the Cold War and tells the story of young Hogarth Hughes from the fictional town of Rockwell, Maine, who's life is changed when he befriends a mysterious 50 ft tall giant robot that crash landed on Earth with no memory of his mission and origins. Hogarth and the otheworldy visitor soon become gain a strong friendship, and has the giant learn about what it's like to have a soul, while at the same time making new friends and avoiding a nosy and paranoid government agent.</h4>
